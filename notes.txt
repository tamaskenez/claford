- always load everything
- format on separate thread, update UI as it goes
- windows test: validate utf8, maybe try setting utf codepage and see what does it help (do we get u8 in path::string()?)
- check refresh rate (fps) lower when possible.
- better ellipsis symbol (need to load that from the font explicitly)
- use gitignore
- use libclangformat
- check if freetype is better than builtin renderer, try to make freetype better (apply srgb gamma to freetype output?)
